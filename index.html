	Step 5 - Load require.js and make it run main.js

	<script src="scripts/require.js" data-main="scripts/main"></script>


	<!-- 
	Step 1.1. Calling require() this way wouldn't work if the requirejs configuration was 
	loaded in 'main.js' instead of 'require-config.js'. If we did that, this script below would be 
	executed before 'main.js' and thefore, the path for 'jquery' would not be loaded yet.

		require(['jquery'], function ($) {
